Simulation of a 2D robot colliding into things.

To download the simulation video, scroll all the way to the bottom of the page. The simulation automatically pauses after about 20 seconds: http://jmcmahon443.github.io/robot-collision.

The code can be viewed on my public GitHub page: https://github.com/jmcmahon443/robot-collision.

I used the EaselJS framework to draw on the canvas, create timed events. I wrote the collision detection code by myself. I used an open source Javascript script to record the screen. I did not have enough time to implement path tracking though.

The random walk moves the robot forward a set number of pixels, and then rotates it randomly to the left or right very slightly. You can see this by refreshing the simulation - the robot takes different paths.
